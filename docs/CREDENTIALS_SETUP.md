# EAS Credentials Setup

## The Issue

You have an Apple Developer account but EAS can't find it. This usually means:

1. **Wrong Apple ID** - The Apple ID you logged in with doesn't have the developer account
2. **Account not in team** - Developer account exists but user isn't added to team
3. **Credentials need to be set manually** - Need to provide them manually

## Quick Fixes

### Option 1: Check Your Apple ID

**Which Apple ID has your developer account?**

```bash
# Check what Apple ID you're using
eas whoami

# If wrong, logout and login with correct Apple ID
eas logout
eas login
```

### Option 2: Manual Credentials

If you already have a TestFlight app running, you have credentials. Let's use those:

```bash
# Try building with manual credential entry
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# When prompted, choose "No" for automatic setup
# Then choose "I would like to add credentials"
```

### Option 3: Use Different Login Method

Try logging in differently:

```bash
# Logout first
eas logout

# Login to EAS (not Apple)
eas login

# Then try building - it will prompt for Apple credentials separately
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# When it asks for Apple credentials, enter the Apple ID that has your developer account
```

## Find Your Apple Team ID

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Look at the top right - you'll see your **Team ID** (like "XXXXXXXX")
3. Note it down

Then build with your Team ID:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE"
```

## Most Likely Solution

Since you have an existing TestFlight app, try this:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on the right EAS account
eas whoami

# 2. Build with the production profile
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# 3. When it asks about Apple account, choose "Yes" 
# 4. Use the SAME Apple ID that you used for the first TestFlight build

# If it still fails, try:
eas build --platform ios --profile production --non-interactive
```

## Alternative: Use Expo's Credential Generation Without Apple Login

Try building without the Apple login prompt:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production --no-wait --non-interactive
```

Then provide credentials later if needed.

## Need Your Info

Please provide:
1. **Apple ID** that has your developer account (might be different from cameroncons@icloud.com)
2. **Do you know your Team ID?** (from developer.apple.com)
3. **When was the first TestFlight build created?**

This will help me give you the exact command to run!

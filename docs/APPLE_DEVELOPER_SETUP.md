# Apple Developer Account Setup

## Current Issue

Your Apple ID (cameroncons@icloud.com) doesn't have an Apple Developer Program membership.

Error: "You have no team associated with your Apple account"

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Enroll in Apple Developer Program (Recommended)

**Cost:** $99/year  
**Time:** Immediate (online)  
**Requirements:** Apple ID

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Click "Enroll"
4. Complete payment ($99/year)
5. Wait for activation (usually instant)

**After enrollment, try again:**
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### Option 2: Build Without App Store (Free for Testing)

If you have an existing TestFlight app, you might be able to update it if:
- You still have the previous build's credentials
- Or you can manually provide credentials

**Try this:**
```bash
# Skip Apple account login
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# If prompted for credentials, skip and we'll add them manually
```

### Option 3: Use Existing Team Credentials

If you have a paid developer account but are using a different Apple ID:

**Provide your team ID:**
```bash
# Find your Team ID in Apple Developer Portal
# https://developer.apple.com/account

eas build --platform ios --profile production --team-id YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Do you have a paid Apple Developer account?
- [ ] Is it under a different Apple ID?
- [ ] Do you want to sign up now ($99)?
- [ ] Or use existing credentials?

## Recommendation

**If you already have a TestFlight app in the store**, you definitely have a developer account. The issue is likely:

1. Wrong Apple ID being used
2. Account not associated with team
3. Need to manually specify team

**Try this:**
```bash
# Build without automatic credential generation
eas build --platform ios --profile production --non-interactive

# Or if you know your Team ID
eas build --platform ios --profile production --team-id "XXXXXXXX"
```

## Next Steps

Let me know:
1. Do you have an existing paid developer account?
2. What Apple ID was used for the previous TestFlight app?
3. Or do you want to sign up for a new one ($99/year)?

Once we have this info, I can provide the exact commands to deploy!

# 🚀 What's Next?

## ✅ What's Complete

1. **Supabase Tables Created** ✅
   - `user_transactions`
   - `user_income`
   - `user_savings_goals`
   - `user_settings`

2. **User Isolation Implemented** ✅
   - FinanceContext uses user-specific keys
   - SettingsContext uses user-specific keys
   - SavingsContext uses user-specific keys

3. **Authentication Working** ✅
   - Sign up/Sign in functional
   - Test account available
   - New Supabase instance configured

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test the App (REQUIRED)

**Test Authentication:**
1. Open app in Expo Go
2. Sign up with a new email
3. Verify you can sign in
4. Try the test account (`test@trilo.app` / `test123456`)

**Test User Isolation:**
1. Sign in as User A
2. Add some transactions/income
3. Sign out
4. Create a NEW account (User B)
5. Verify User B sees EMPTY data ✅
6. Sign back in as User A
7. Verify your data is still there ✅

### 2. Optional: Test in Supabase Dashboard

**Check Your Data:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: `raictkrsnejvfvpgqzcq`
3. Go to **Table Editor**
4. Click on `user_transactions`
5. You might see data from your test transactions

**Note:** Currently, data is stored **locally on device** with user-specific keys. Data in Supabase tables will appear once we enable cloud sync.

## 🔜 Optional Future Enhancements

### Option A: Keep It Simple (Current Setup)
- ✅ User data isolation works
- ✅ Data persists locally per user
- ✅ App is fully functional
- ⚠️ Data is device-specific (no cloud backup)

### Option B: Add Cloud Sync (Recommended for Production)

To enable Supabase cloud storage:

1. **Update contexts to use Supabase:**
   - Implement sync logic in `context/FinanceContext.tsx`
   - Use `HybridDataService` to save to both local + Supabase

2. **Benefits:**
   - ✅ Data syncs across devices
   - ✅ Cloud backup (never lose data)
   - ✅ Can access from web dashboard
   - ✅ Multi-device support

3. **Files Ready:**
   - `services/SupabaseDataService.ts` - Already created
   - `services/HybridDataService.ts` - Already created
   - Just need to integrate into contexts

### Option C: Add Features
- [ ] Budget creation and tracking
- [ ] Recurring expense management
- [ ] Spending analytics/charts
- [ ] Income forecasting
- [ ] Financial goals and milestones

## 📋 Current Data Flow

# How to Verify Your Supabase Setup is Complete ✅

## Step 1: Check Your Supabase Dashboard

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard

Click on your project: **raictkrsnejvfvpgqzcq**

### Look for These in the Dashboard:

#### ✅ In "Table Editor"
You should see these 4 tables:
- `user_transactions` - Stores transactions per user
- `user_income` - Stores income per user  
- `user_savings_goals` - Stores savings goals per user
- `user_settings` - Stores user settings

#### ✅ In "Authentication" → "Policies"
You should see RLS policies for each table:
- "Users can view own transactions"
- "Users can insert own transactions"
- "Users can update own transactions"
- "Users can delete own transactions"
- (And similar for income, savings_goals, settings)

If you see these, **you did it right!** ✅

## Step 2: Test in the App

### Test Authentication Flow:

1. **Sign Up** - Create a new account
   - Open app
   - Tap "Create Account"
   - Use any email/password
   - Sign up

2. **Verify in Supabase**
   - Go to: Authentication → Users
   - You should see your new user there! ✅

3. **Add Some Data**
   - Sign in to the app
   - Add an expense
   - Add income
   - Check the transactions appear

4. **Test User Isolation**
   - Sign out of the app
   - Create a NEW account with different email
   - Sign in
   - You should see EMPTY data (no expenses from the first user)
   - Add some data
   - Sign out
   - Sign back in as the FIRST user
   - You should see YOUR data (the second user's data shouldn't be there)

5. **Verify It Worked**
   - Each user sees only their own data ✅
   - Users cannot see each other's data ✅
   - Data persists after sign out/sign in ✅

---

## Step 3: Test the Test Account

1. **Sign in with test account**
   - Email: `test@trilo.app`
   - Password: `test123456`
   - Should sign in successfully

2. **Add some data**
   - Add a few transactions
   - Sign out
   - Sign back in
   - Your data should still be there ✅

---

## What You Should See in Supabase Tables

Go to **Table Editor** → Click on any table

You should see:
- **Empty tables** (if you haven't added data yet through the app)
- Each table has these columns:
  - `id` (UUID)
  - `user_id` (UUID - links to auth.users)
  - `amount`, `category`, `type`, `date`, etc.
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`

---

## How to Know You Did It Right

✅ **In Supabase Dashboard:**
- You see 4 tables
- You see RLS policies
- Authentication works
- Tables are empty initially

✅ **In the App:**
- Sign up works
- Sign in works
- Each user sees only their data
- Data persists after logout
- Users cannot see each other's data

---

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Tables don't exist"
- Go to SQL Editor
- Run the SQL again
- Check for errors

### Issue: "Cannot sign up"
- Check Supabase is online
- Check credentials in app.json
- Try the test account first

### Issue: "See 'already exists' error"
- ✅ This means it worked!
- Tables are already created
- You're good to go!

---

## Summary

If you got the "already exists" error, that means:
1. ✅ SQL ran successfully the first time
2. ✅ Tables were created
3. ✅ Policies were created
4. ✅ You're ready to test!

Now test the app with sign up/sign in!
